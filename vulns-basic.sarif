If an untrusted XML document was parsed in recovery mode and post-validated, the flaw could be used to crash the application. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to system availability.\n\n### Risk Assessment\n- **Severity:** MEDIUM (5.9)\n- **Exploitation Risk:** Low (EPSS: 0.001)\n\n### Remediation\n1. **PRIORITY:** Update the component to the latest version that fixes this vulnerability\n2. **Monitor:** Check for security advisories and patches\n3. **Automate:** Implement automated dependency scanning and updates\n4. **Validate:** Test patches in a staging environment before production deployment\n\n### References\n- [NVD Details](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3537)\n- [CVE Details](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-3537)\n- [EPSS Details](https://www.first.org/epss/model)\n- Additional References:\n  - [secalert@redhat.com](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1956522)\n  - [secalert@redhat.com](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/05/msg00008.html)\n  - [secalert@redhat.com](https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce%40lists.fedoraproject.org/message/BZOMV5J4PMZAORVT64BKLV6YIZAFDGX6/)"
